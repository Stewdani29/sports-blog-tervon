            Trevon Diggs makes it clear that his brother, Stefon, should leave Buffalo!</h1>

        <h5 style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.3;font-weight:bold;'>The
            injured Dallas Cowboys defensive back made it clear watching Monday Night Football last night: his brother,
            Stefon, needs to get out of Buffalo ASAP!</h5>
        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'>There is some MAJOR drama in
            Buffalo! The Bills offense is a shadow of itself in 2023 from external and internal stressors. Last night,
            QB Josh Allen and the hometown Bills struggled in a third loss in four weeks.</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'> This time to the often
            self-destructive Denver Broncos.</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'> But last night's game
            highlighted a growing concern amongst Buffalo fans.</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'> Josh Allen is a turnover
            machine who tries to do too much. The frustration of the skill players is boiling over to the point that the
            offensive coordinator - Ken Dorsey - was fired. Head coach Sean McDermott finds himself firmly on the hot
            seat with his talented squad now 5-5.</p>

        <h2 style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.3;font-weight:bold;'>Stefon
            Diggs, especially, has been frustrated.</h2>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'> The elite wideout has been
            seen vocalizing his frustrations with the coaching staff and his QB on the sideline during games over the
            last season and a half.</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'> Those frustrations might
            boil over into more if his brother - Dallas Cowboys DB Trevon Diggs - has any idea what his brother is going
            through/feeling about the trajectory of the franchise.</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'>Shots fired? Shots fired!
        </p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'>Shots fired? Shots
            fired!Trevon made it clear - and then doubled down - that one, Allen is not doing enough to get his brother
            the ball. And two, Buffalo is not the right place for the talented pass-catcher.</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'>Does Trevon's word carry any
            weight? It sure does!</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'>Stefon might not be feeling
            as negatively as his brother might indicate on Twitter, but there must be some truth to it.</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'>Look at what has happened to
            Diggs' production in recent weeks.</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'>He had over 100 yards
            receiving yards in five of the first six games.</p>

        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'>He has not hit the century
            mark in the last four.</p>

        
        <p style='font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif; font-size:42px;line-height: 1.3;font-weight:bold;'>Is this Stefon's last year with the Bills?</p>
            
        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'>Rumblings on social media suggest that we could see a split between Stefon Diggs and the Buffalo Bills similar to the one we saw with the Minnesota Vikings a few years ago.</p>
            
        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4;'>That may depend on how the offense does down the stretch - and whether or not the Bills make the postseason.</p>
        <p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.3rem;line-height: 1.4; font-weight: bold;'>Could the Diggs brothers be partnering up with the Dallas Cowboys next season? I could see it happening!</p>
